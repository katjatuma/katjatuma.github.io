# Katja Tuma

 In 2021 I joined the <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/research/computer-systems/foundational-security/index.aspx" target="_blank">Foundational and Experimental Security</a> research group as Assistant Professor (Universitair docent 2) and am working at the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, which I completed at the <a href="https://www.gu.se" target="_blank">University of Gothenburg</a>.
 
 

# Research

In my research, I work on observing and helping experts in their reasoning about how to handle security threats. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Security-by-design.** Threat modeling and risk analysis, automating security analysis of software architecture, compliance of code to the intended security, reverse engineering security.

- **Empirical methods for security.** Designing and conducting controlled experiments, industrial case studies and studies involving human participants.

# Fun

Foraging mushrooms. This is what I see when I look at a forest. Recently, also rock-climbing.
