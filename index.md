# Bio
Katja Tuma holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, completed at the <a href="https://www.gu.se" target="_blank">University of Gothenburg</a>. In 2021 Katja joined the <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/research/computer-systems/foundational-security/index.aspx" target="_blank">Foundational Security</a> research group (chaired by Prof. Fabio Massacci) as Assistant Professor (Universitair docent 2) and is working at the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>.


She pursued her Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Riccardo Scandariato on the topic of **secure software design** in Sweden. She was hosted by Jan Jürjens at the <a href="https://rgse.uni-koblenz.de/web/pages/home/index_en.shtml" target="_blank">RGSE group</a> (at the University of Koblenz-Landau) as a visiting researcher for three months, for which she was awarded the DAAD scholarship. She also takes an active role in the community, for instance by serving as a PC member and reviewer. In addition to her academic service, Katja has actively contributed to the undergraduate education at the University of Gothenburg by helping to design a new course (Mathematical Foundations for Software Engineering), which she taught for four consecutive years. 


# Research

My research interests are in the area of secure software design with the focus on:

- **Security-by-design.** Threat modeling and risk analysis, automating security analysis of software architecture, compliance of code to the intended security, reverse engineering security.

- **Empirical methods for security.** Designing and conducting controlled experiments, industrial case studies and studies involving human participants.

# Fun

Foraging mushrooms. This is what I see when I look at a forest. Recently also rock-climbing.
