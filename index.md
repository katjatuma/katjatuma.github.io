# Katja Tuma

 In 2021 I joined the <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/research/computer-systems/foundational-and-experimental-security/index.aspx" target="_blank">Foundational and Experimental Security</a> research group as Assistant Professor (Universitair docent 2) and am working at the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, which I completed at the <a href="https://www.gu.se" target="_blank">University of Gothenburg</a>.

# Research

I am passionate about building and evaluating methods for analyzing security threats and vulnerabilities in software systems. I like to work on solving practical problems with direct impact to the society. I particularly focus on:

- **Security-by-design.** Threat modeling and risk analysis, automating security analysis of software architecture, compliance of code to the intended security.

- **Empirical methods for security.** Designing and conducting controlled experiments, industrial case studies and studies involving human participants.

## Selected publications

# Fun

Foraging mushrooms. This is what I see when I look at a forest. Recently, also rock-climbing.
