# Research

I am passionate about building and evaluating methods for analyzing security threats and vulnerabilities in software systems. I like to work on solving practical problems with direct impact to the society. I particularly focus on:


- **Empirical methods for security.** Designing and conducting controlled experiments, industrial case studies and studies involving human participants.
- **Measuring human aspects (e.g., diversity) in security threat analysis.** Risk perception, gender bias, diversity processes in technical (i.e., security) domain. 
- **Security-by-design.** Threat modeling and risk analysis, automating security analysis of software architecture, compliance of code to the intended security.

Are you interested to do a **thesis** with me? Find the current thesis topics <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkegnctu8-mDEP27_cQ3KED4TXoDhvCIyIf2ogs_3t4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!

# Fun

Foraging mushrooms. This is what I see when I look at a forest. Recently, also rock-climbing.
