# Bio
Katja Tuma holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, completed at the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University in Sweden. Previously, Katja completed her MSc in Computer Science at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Early-on, she studied abroad at Reykjavik University and Malmö University, where she discovered her curiosity for research. 

She pursued her Ph.D. degree on the topic of **secure software design** in Sweden, where under the supervision of Riccardo Scandariato she published in top software engineering conferences and journals, including JSS and MODELS. She was hosted by Jan Jürjens at the RGSE group (at the University of Koblenz-Landau) as a visiting researcher for three months, for which she was awarded the DAAD scholarship. She also takes an active role in the community, for instance by serving as a PC member for the GraMSec and SecureMDE workshops. In addition to her academic service, Katja has actively contributed to the undergraduate education at the University of Gothenburg by helping to design a new course from scratch (Mathematical Foundations for Software Engineering), which she taught for four consecutive years. 

In 2021 Katja joined the Foundational Security research group (chaired by Prof. Fabio Massacci) and is working at the Vrije Universiteit in the Netherlands as Assistant Professor, tenure track. 

# Research

My research interests are in the area of secure software design with the focus on:

<ul>

<li>
***Security-by-design.*** Threat modeling and risk analysis, automating security analysis of software architecture, compliance of code to the intended security, reverse engineering security. </li>

<li>
***Empirical methods for security.*** Designing and conducting controlled experiments, industrial case studies and studies involving human participants.
</li>
</ul>

# Fun
- Foraging mushrooms and coming up with new recipes!

Here is how my nearby forest in Sweden looks like:


- Rock-climbing (more recently)
